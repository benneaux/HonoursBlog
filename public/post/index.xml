      <description>One of the goals of my project is to try and identify changes in the structure of the various flutracking time series (initially the % of unvaccinated respondents reporting ILI symptoms). There are two reasons for this that inspire two separate lines of inquiry: does the structure change from year to year; and does the structure change within each year?
Here we will be using Chow’s test to test for structural breaks in the flutracking data.</description>
